During this time, empirical antimicrobial therapy is \nadministered with the expectation that the regimen will be revised once a pathogen is defined \nand susceptibility results are obtained. The selection of an optimal empiric regimen is usually \nbroad and is based on factors that relate to patient characteristics, prior antimicrobial \nexposures and microbiological findings, and epidemiological features. \n• \nPET-CT scan can be done in patients with inconclusive echocardiography or in those patients \nin whom TEE is not possible. \nReference: \n1.
