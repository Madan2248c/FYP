When should empirical colistin or polymyxin B be added in febrile neutropenic patients? \n• \nHaemodynamic instability. \n• \nColonisation with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. \n• \nPrevious infection with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. \n• \nGNB in blood, sensitivity pending, persistent fever with haemodynamic instability. \n",
