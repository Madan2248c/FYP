However, all pulp infections should be treated by doing root \ncanal treatment and debridement. In rare cases when peri-apical infection spreads to other \nsoft tissue planes and cause systemic symptoms like fever, malaise and extensive swelling then \nthey can be treated with systemic antibiotics.  \n \n \n \n",
