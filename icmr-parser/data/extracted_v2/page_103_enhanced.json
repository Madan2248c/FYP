When to start Empirical Antifungal Therapy:  \n• \nEmpirical antifungal therapy is not advised unless patient is unstable, use of CT chest and \nfungal biomarkers like serum Galactomannan and serum beta D glucan is encouraged. \n• \nFebrile after 72 hrs of antibiotic therapy. \nAdditional information: \n• \nUnexplained persistent fever in the otherwise stable patient doesn’t require a change in \nempirical antibiotic regimen. Continue the regimen till ANC is >500 cells/mm3. \n• \nIf glycopeptide has been started as a part of empirical regimen, STOP after 48 hrs, if no \nevidence of gram-positive infection. \n• \nAntibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenia can be stopped if patients are afebrile for 3 days, \nprovision for close observation is present and culture negative irrespective of ANC recovery. \n• \nShifting to oral antibiotics during neutropenia can be done if stable and susceptibility to the \noral drug has been demonstrated.  \nReferences: \n1.
