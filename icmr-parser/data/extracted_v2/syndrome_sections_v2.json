For example: antibiotics like \ncarbapenems, BL-BLI like amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam, cefoperazone-\nsulbactam and tigecycline have good an-aerobic cover, so adding metronidazole is not \nwarranted. (Annexure A) \n• \nDiscontinue antibiotics if a non-infectious etiology is identified. \n• \nDe-escalate combination therapy to a single agent. \n• \nChange a broad-spectrum antibiotic to a narrow spectrum one. \n• \nChange IV to oral antibiotics. \n• \nDe-escalation is safe in all patients including febrile neutropenia and septic shock and reduces \nmortality and length of hospital stay. \n \n \n\n\n \n14 \n \nNote: \n• \nIt is emphasized that antimicrobials should be prescribed only when they are \nnecessary for treatment following a definitive diagnosis.  \n• \nNot all patients need antibiotics; in many cases only symptomatic management may \nbe suitable and this has been emphasized in these guidelines. In all cases, the benefit \nof administering the medicine should be considered in relation to the risk involved. \nThis is particularly important during pregnancy where the risk to both mother and \nfoetus must be considered. The content of these treatment guidelines will undergo a \nprocess of continuous review. Comments or suggestions for improvement are \nwelcome.

During this time, empirical antimicrobial therapy is \nadministered with the expectation that the regimen will be revised once a pathogen is defined \nand susceptibility results are obtained. The selection of an optimal empiric regimen is usually \nbroad and is based on factors that relate to patient characteristics, prior antimicrobial \nexposures and microbiological findings, and epidemiological features. \n• \nPET-CT scan can be done in patients with inconclusive echocardiography or in those patients \nin whom TEE is not possible. \nReference: \n1.

Febrile Syndromes \n3.1 Acute Undifferentiated Febrile illness \nAcute febrile syndrome presents with headache, chills, or muscle and joint pains and is usually viral \nand often resolves without treatment. Acute febrile syndrome can also be caused by bacterial, \nrickettsial or parasitic infections and non-infective conditions like autoimmune disorders. Timing of \nblood tests is important for diagnosing it correctly. \nDay 1 or 2 (of fever onset): A. Defer investigations or use of antimicrobials.  \nDay 3 or 4 (of fever onset): B. Total leukocyte count with differential, liver function tests, renal function \ntests, complete urine examination and random blood sugar and further investigations based on clinical \nsymptoms and risk factors like: test for dengue antigen, peripheral blood smear for malarial parasite \nand rapid diagnostic test for malaria. \n> 5 days of fever: C. Tests in B as above and 2 sets of blood cultures. Serology (IgM) for dengue, \nchikungunya, scrub typhus, leptospirosis can be done based on clinical suspicion. X-ray chest PA view. \n> 7 days of fever: D. Tests as in C as above and USG abdomen and other tests as appropriate \nIf the patient is immunocompromised, focus on early investigations to know the organism responsible \nand organ system affected. \nEven though most of the viral infections are self-limiting, influenza can lead to severe respiratory failure \nin immunocompromised hosts especially in elderly.

Aspiration is easier to \n\n\n \n \n38 \n \nachieve when the content is liquid enough to be drained.

The patient may experience pain, \nredness, swelling and blistering. Second degree can again be classified as second degree \nsuperficial which involves epidermis and the papillary dermis and Second-degree deep burns \nwhich involves the deeper reticular dermis as well. \n• \nThird-degree burns: affect epidermis and dermis. The burn also destroys hair follicles and \nsweat glands. Because third-degree burns damage nerve endings, you probably won’t feel pain \nin the area of the burn itself, rather adjacent to it. Burned skin may be black, white or brown \nwith a leathery appearance. \n• \nConsider Lund & Browder’s chart for burn wound estimation. \n• \nBurns greater than 20% surface area (adult), greater than 10% (child) or any burn occurring in \nthe extremes of age are considered serious.  \n• \nManagement of major burns: Airways, oxygen inhalation, securing central venous line, \nadequate and proper Fluid Resuscitation, pain relief with analgesia and sedation, isolation of \n\n\n \n \n94 \n \npatient, NG Tube, foleys catheter & H2 receptor antagonists, Tetanus prophylaxis, Care of burn \nwound and operative management as necessary & other supportive measures etc. \n• \nPatient’s energy and protein requirements will be extremely high due to the systemic \nhypermetabolic response with gluconeogenesis, insulin resistance and protein catabolism, \nheat loss, infection and demands of tissue regeneration. If necessary, feed the patient through \na nasogastric tube to ensure an adequate energy intake (up to 6000 kcal a day). Consultation \nwith dietician and nutritionist is necessary for each burn patient to ensure adequate calorie \nintake according to Curreri Formula: \nAdult- 25 kcal/Kg+ 40kcal X %TBSA \nChildren- 60kcal/ Kg + 35 kcal X % TBSA  \n• \nGastroparesis is common, and prokinetic agents such as metoclopramide is helpful in \npromoting gastric emptying. \n• \nProtein and multivitamin supplements are indicated for these patients. Serum prealbumin \nlevels are checked every 3 days to monitor nutritional status.  \n• \nAnaemia and malnutrition prevent burn wound healing and result in failure of skin grafts. \n• \nSystemic antibiotics are generally in early post burn period. \n• \nFever is not a useful sign of an infection, as it may persists due to burn per se. \n• \nSystemic antibiotics can be initiated in proven septicaemia or can be given empirically as per \nhospital antibiograms for suspected sepsis awaiting culture results. \nReferences: \n1.

When should empirical colistin or polymyxin B be added in febrile neutropenic patients? \n• \nHaemodynamic instability. \n• \nColonisation with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. \n• \nPrevious infection with carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria. \n• \nGNB in blood, sensitivity pending, persistent fever with haemodynamic instability. \n\n\n \n \n \n3.

Continue the regimen till ANC is >500 cells/mm3. \n• \nIf glycopeptide has been started as a part of empirical regimen, STOP after 48 hrs, if no \nevidence of gram-positive infection. \n• \nAntibiotic therapy in febrile neutropenia can be stopped if patients are afebrile for 3 days, \nprovision for close observation is present and culture negative irrespective of ANC recovery. \n• \nShifting to oral antibiotics during neutropenia can be done if stable and susceptibility to the \noral drug has been demonstrated.  \nReferences: \n1.
