Febrile Syndromes \n3.1 Acute Undifferentiated Febrile illness \nAcute febrile syndrome presents with headache, chills, or muscle and joint pains and is usually viral \nand often resolves without treatment. Acute febrile syndrome can also be caused by bacterial, \nrickettsial or parasitic infections and non-infective conditions like autoimmune disorders. Timing of \nblood tests is important for diagnosing it correctly. \nDay 1 or 2 (of fever onset): A. Defer investigations or use of antimicrobials.  \nDay 3 or 4 (of fever onset): B. Total leukocyte count with differential, liver function tests, renal function \ntests, complete urine examination and random blood sugar and further investigations based on clinical \nsymptoms and risk factors like: test for dengue antigen, peripheral blood smear for malarial parasite \nand rapid diagnostic test for malaria. \n> 5 days of fever: C. Tests in B as above and 2 sets of blood cultures. Serology (IgM) for dengue, \nchikungunya, scrub typhus, leptospirosis can be done based on clinical suspicion. X-ray chest PA view. \n> 7 days of fever: D. Tests as in C as above and USG abdomen and other tests as appropriate \nIf the patient is immunocompromised, focus on early investigations to know the organism responsible \nand organ system affected. \nEven though most of the viral infections are self-limiting, influenza can lead to severe respiratory failure \nin immunocompromised hosts especially in elderly. This patient subset will benefit with early diagnosis \nwith \nmolecular \ndiagnostics \nand \nearly \ntreatment \nwith \nantivirals.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n",
