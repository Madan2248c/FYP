Amoxicillin-clavulanate  \nb. Ampicillin-sulbactam  \nc. Cefoperazone-sulbactam \nd. Clindamycin*  \ne. Doripenem  \nf. Ertapenem \ng. Imipenem  \nh. Meropenem  \ni. \nMetronidazole \nj. \nPiperacillin-tazobactam  \nk. Ticarcillin-clavulanate  \nl. \nTigecycline \nPoints to consider while using antimicrobial agents with anaerobic activity: \n1. The combined use of two antimicrobials with anaerobic cover mentioned above is \nunnecessary and should be avoided to prevent additional toxicity. \n2. Exceptions to (1) are: \na. Clostridioides difficile infection \nb. Amoebic colitis or Amoebic liver abscess \n *- Clindamycin: \nNot active against Gram –negative anaerobes, so should not be used for infections where \nGram-negative anaerobes are suspected (eg: intra-abdominal infections) \nReferences: \n1.Implementation of Antibiotic Stewardship Core Elements at Small and Critical Access Hospitals. \nCenters \nfor \nDisease \nControl \nand \nPrevention, \nwww.cdc.gov/antibiotic-\nuse/healthcare/implementation/core-elements-small-critical.html.  \n2.
