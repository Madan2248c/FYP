Second degree can again be classified as second degree \nsuperficial which involves epidermis and the papillary dermis and Second-degree deep burns \nwhich involves the deeper reticular dermis as well. \n• \nThird-degree burns: affect epidermis and dermis. The burn also destroys hair follicles and \nsweat glands. Because third-degree burns damage nerve endings, you probably won’t feel pain \nin the area of the burn itself, rather adjacent to it. Burned skin may be black, white or brown \nwith a leathery appearance. \n• \nConsider Lund & Browder’s chart for burn wound estimation. \n• \nBurns greater than 20% surface area (adult), greater than 10% (child) or any burn occurring in \nthe extremes of age are considered serious.  \n• \nManagement of major burns: Airways, oxygen inhalation, securing central venous line, \nadequate and proper Fluid Resuscitation, pain relief with analgesia and sedation, isolation of \n",
